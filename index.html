                <strong>running the tao te ching - 2</strong>
            </h1>

            <p>When runners see some runs as beautiful<br />
other runs become ugly<br />
When runners see some runs as good<br />
other runs become bad</p>

<p>Running and non-running create each other<br />
Difficult and easy runs support each other<br />
Long and short runs define each other<br />
A runner&rsquo;s highs and lows depend on each other<br />
The time before and after running follow each other</p>

<p>Therefore the Master<br />
runs without doing anything<br />
and instructs without saying anything<br />
Things arise and she lets them come<br />
Things disappear and she lets them go<br />
She has ability without possessing it<br />
runs without expectation</p>

<p>When her run is finished, she forgets it<br />
that is why it lasts forever</p>
