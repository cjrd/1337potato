      <description>When runners see some runs as beautiful
other runs become ugly
When runners see some runs as good
other runs become bad
Running and non-running create each other
Difficult and easy runs support each other
Long and short runs define each other
A runner&amp;rsquo;s highs and lows depend on each other
The time before and after running follow each other
Therefore the Master
runs without doing anything
and instructs without saying anything</description>
