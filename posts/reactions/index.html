        <p>It&rsquo;s easier to let other people find things to do with my time. React to their needs.<br>
It feels productive to make progress for others. To see that I can help them.<br>
Responding to emails, attending meetings, looking at Slack alerts.</p>
<p>So I sit down to do some deep work: some heavy thought about big projects. And I find myself checking my email and looking for Slack alerts. Secretly hoping someone else will block out the next hour for me, so that I don&rsquo;t have to drive forward my own thoughts. Because it&rsquo;s hard to do that. It hurts to do that. I feel incompetent and inadequate when I do that.</p>
<p>But letting this happen leads to a busy, ostensibly productive life of doing very little. But as a declaration of focus, let me say that I will choose my time, and explicitly accept that it will be more difficult to do this. I will have to let others down, and I will likely fail quite a bit. But it&rsquo;s better than the alternative.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s get started on some of those future failing ideas.</p>
