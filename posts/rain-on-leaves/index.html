But &#34;rain on leaves&#34; is focusing on the enjoyable when you have every reason to feel sorry for unfortunate circumstances." />

        <p>Rain began to beat down on me yesterday morning.</p>

<p>I was trail running.<br />
I woke up before the sun.<br />
My mind was clear.<br />
I was doing my part.</p>

<p>But the rain beat down on my path. It began to pour, and I could hear the orchestra of the raining forest: rain on leaves.</p>

<p>And when I think about the sound of rain on leaves, I think of relaxation. I imagine most people do. It&rsquo;s used in spas and healing centers, white noise machines and concentration soundtracks.</p>

<p>But I was wet, and my fingers were numb. It wasn&rsquo;t a spa or a sleep aid. It was uncomfortable.
The rain on the leaves was uncomfortable.
I had every reason to feel uncomfortable, to put my mind in a state of discomfort and feel sorry for my bad luck.</p>

<p>I had every reason to feel sorry for my unfortunate circumstances.</p>

<p>Or.<br />
I could listen to the rain on the leaves.</p>
