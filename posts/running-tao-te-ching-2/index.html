        <p>While reading the Tao Te Ching, I found that certain chapters connect very well with running. In order to further connect with these chapters myself, I &ldquo;translated&rdquo; them into a form that directly connects with running, which is a fundamental part of my life.</p>

<p>This is from <a href="http://taoteching.org.uk/index.php?c=2&amp;a=Stephen+Mitchell">Chapter 2 of the Tao Te Ching</a>; translated by Stephen Mitchell:</p>

<hr />

<p>Seeing some runs as beautiful<br />
makes other runs ugly<br />
Seeing some runs as good<br />
makes other runs bad</p>

<p>Running and non-running create each other<br />
Difficult and easy runs support each other<br />
Long and short runs define each other<br />
A runner&rsquo;s highs and lows depend on each other<br />
The time before and after running follow each other</p>

<p>Therefore the Master<br />
runs without doing anything<br />
and instructs without saying anything<br />
Things arise and she lets them come<br />
Things disappear and she lets them go<br />
She has ability without possessing it<br />
runs without expectation</p>

<p>When her run is finished, she forgets it<br />
that is why it lasts forever</p>
