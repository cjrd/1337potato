      <title>Reacting is Easier</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easier to let other people occupy my time. React to their needs.&lt;br /&gt;
It feels productive to make progress for others. To see that I can help them.&lt;br /&gt;
Responding to emails, attending meetings, looking at Slack alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I sit down to do some deep work: some heavy thought about big projects. And I find myself checking my email and looking for Slack alerts. Secretly hoping someone else will block out the next hour for me, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to drive forward my own thoughts. Because it&amp;rsquo;s hard to do that. It hurts to do that. I feel incompetent and inadequate when I do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But letting this happen leads to a busy, ostensibly productive life of doing very little. But as a declaration of focus, let me say that I will choose my time, and explicitly accept that it will be more difficult to do this. I will have to let others down, and I will likely fail quite a bit. But it&amp;rsquo;s better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s get started on some of those future failing ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rain on Leaves</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rain began to beat down on me yesterday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trail running.&lt;br /&gt;
I woke up before the sun.&lt;br /&gt;
My mind was clear.&lt;br /&gt;
I was doing my part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the rain beat down on my path. It began to pour, and I could hear the orchestra of the raining forest: rain on leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I think about the sound of rain on leaves, I think of relaxation. I imagine most people do. It&amp;rsquo;s used in spas and healing centers, white noise machines and concentration soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was wet, and my fingers were numb. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a spa or a sleep aid. It was uncomfortable.
The rain on the leaves was uncomfortable.
I had every reason to feel uncomfortable, to put my mind in a state of discomfort and feel sorry for my bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had every reason to feel sorry for my unfortunate circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or.&lt;br /&gt;
I could listen to the rain on the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tao of Running - Everything Balances</title>
      <link>https://1337potato.com/posts/running-tao-te-ching-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading the Tao Te Ching, I found that certain chapters connect very well with running. In order to further connect with these chapters myself, I &amp;ldquo;translated&amp;rdquo; them into a form that directly connects with running, which is a fundamental part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://taoteching.org.uk/index.php?c=2&amp;amp;a=Stephen+Mitchell&#34;&gt;Chapter 2 of the Tao Te Ching&lt;/a&gt;; translated by Stephen Mitchell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing some runs as beautiful&lt;br /&gt;
makes other runs ugly&lt;br /&gt;
Seeing some runs as good&lt;br /&gt;
makes other runs bad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running and non-running create each other&lt;br /&gt;
Difficult and easy runs support each other&lt;br /&gt;
Long and short runs define each other&lt;br /&gt;
A runner&amp;rsquo;s highs and lows depend on each other&lt;br /&gt;
The time before and after running follow each other&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the Master&lt;br /&gt;
runs without doing anything&lt;br /&gt;
and instructs without saying anything&lt;br /&gt;
Things arise and she lets them come&lt;br /&gt;
Things disappear and she lets them go&lt;br /&gt;
She has ability without possessing it&lt;br /&gt;
runs without expectation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When her run is finished, she forgets it&lt;br /&gt;
that is why it lasts forever&lt;/p&gt;
